## A Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for Smart Cities

### Description

The increasing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities and smart farms has led to an upsurge in security threats. These threats not only compromise the integrity of the data but also pose a serious risk to the safety of the environment and human lives. To tackle this issue, the use of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has gained significant attention.

In this project, we focused on developing a Machine learning-based IDS for smart cities and smart farms. The project involved an extensive literature review of various research papers in the domain. We also carried out simulations in Contiki, NetSim, and Real Hardware to obtain a good and balanced dataset.

To develop an efficient IDS, we pre-processed and encoded data in multiple datasets and applied machine learning techniques to determine if there is an attack or not. In particular, we applied Neural networks to achieve our goal. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aimed to achieve high accuracy and low false alarm rates in detecting intrusions in IoT networks.

Overall, our research aimed to contribute to the development of effective IDSs for smart cities and smart farms, enabling the secure deployment and usage of IoT devices in these domains.

### Repository Content

This repository covers a diverse range of resources and materials that have been carefully analised to support research and development in the field of machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT). It consists of four main directories: Contiki/Simulations, Documents, Diagrams, and Neural Networks.

The Contiki/Simulations directory hosts a collection of simulations designed to evaluate and analyze the performance of IoT systems based on the Contiki operating system. These simulations provide insights into network behavior, and the usage of different network protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP.

The Documents directory contains an assortment of comprehensive documentation, including research papers, technical reports, and user guides. These documents serve as references, presenting in-depth analyses, methodologies, and experimental results related to our research work.

The Diagrams directory comprises a variety of visual representations, such as architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and network topologies. These diagrams help to illustrate complex concepts, system designs, and interactions, enhancing the understanding and communication of our research findings.

The Neural Networks directory is dedicated to machine learning implementations. It houses a collection of notebooks that showcase various algorithms, models, and techniques employed in our research. Additionally, this directory contains the results of our experiments, including visual plots, performance metrics, and datasets used and saved during the training and evaluation processes.

Collectively, the contents of this repository offer a comprehensive and insightful resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts seeking to explore the fascinating intersection of machine learning and IoT.
